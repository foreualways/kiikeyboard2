Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I get a warning about this keyboard collecting my personal data?
--------------------------------------

You don't need to worry about that message. It\'s a standard warning message that is shown whenever you enabled a keyboard from the Google play store, including keyboards that were made by Google. Kii Keyboard does NOT collect any personal data.


Something stops working all of the sudden...
--------------------------------------

If something used to work and stop working all of the sudden. You may want to check the following:

- Have you tried restarting the phone? Sometimes a bug in Android can be resolved by simply restarting your device. 

- Did it stop working after you updated the app? If yes, it may be a bug with the update, contact the developer to let him know, it will likely to be fixed in the next update.

- Did it stop working after you change the settings? If yes, you may want to uninstall/reinstall Kii Keyboard to reset its settings so that it's back to a clean state.

Some words cannot be gesture inputted, for example 'nasty'...
--------------------------------------

Many 'offensive' words have very low priority so that the auto-correction algorithm will not suggest such words by accident. For example, you will never want 'duck' to be auto-corrected to 'fuck'. For some unknown reasons, the word 'nasty' was marked as an offensive word in Android's English dictionary (which Kii Keyboard also uses), therefore it's difficult to swipe the word 'nasty' due to its low priority in the dictionary. 

To fix this, you can add the word 'nasty' to the user dictionary, which forces it priority to increase. That way the word 'nasty' will show up when you swipe. Be careful when adding offensive words to the user dictionary for the reasons stated above. ï»¿
